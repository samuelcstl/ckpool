 * Work-source arbiter helpers for the SV2 job declaration client: how a tip
 * the pool announces relates to our own chain, and whether it is plausible
 * enough to expect our node to catch up to it.
 *
 * Ported from sv2-apps miner-apps/jd-client/src/lib/channel_manager/tip_bridge.rs
 * at commit 8ce74f74("Merge branch 'jd-accept-remote-work' into jd-ckp"), keeping
 * its classification so the two implementations stay comparable. Pure: no locks
 * and no globals, so the caller owns both the ring and the state machine, and
 * test/sv2_bridge.c can exercise every branch.
