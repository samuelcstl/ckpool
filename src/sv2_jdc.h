 * Stratum V2 Job Declaration Client (JDC) — ckproxy side.
 *
 * Templates come from the Bitcoin Core mining IPC (createNewBlock + getBlock +
 * waitTipChanged) and are declared to the pool's JDS over a second Noise
 * session. An accepted declare becomes a SetCustomMiningJob on the mining
 * connection, and its job_id then carries downstream work and shares.
 *
 * Declaring needs the pool to be on the same tip we are, so this side also keeps
 * the local tip history the work-source arbiter classifies pool tips against;
 * the generator owns the state machine itself, since it
 * owns the downstream fanout.
