 * One transaction has three on-wire shapes and they must
 * describe identical bytes:
 *
 *   DeclareMiningJob   coinbase_tx_prefix ‖ <extranonce hole> ‖ coinbase_tx_suffix
 *   SetCustomMiningJob coinbase_prefix (scriptSig bytes only) + outputs + fields
 *   SV1 notify         coinb1 = declare prefix ‖ channel prefix ‖ pad, coinb2 = suffix
 *
 * The first two are built here from one spec so they cannot drift, and the
 * assembler is the same code the server uses to hash custom-job shares.
