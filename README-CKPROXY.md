# Stratum proxy installation

## All-in-one proxy quickstart

```bash
wget https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/ckolivas/ckpool/src/master/scripts/install-ckproxy.sh
sudo scripts/install-ckproxy.sh
```

This will download the latest ckpool source code, install the required build
packages, build and install ckpool, and set up ckproxy as a systemd service.
Follow the prompts to configure your upstream pool(s) and the local port for
your miners to connect to.

Should work on any .deb or .rpm based linux distribution (ubuntu, debian,
fedora, centos, rhel, and derivatives such as mint, pop, raspbian, kali,
devuan, rocky, alma, oracle and amazon linux, identified by the ID_LIKE field
in /etc/os-release) to download required packages. Installs as a systemd
service running as the current user but can configure a new ckpool user
instead.

You will be prompted for one or more upstream pools to connect to. Pools are
tried in the order entered, with automatic failover to the next entry if the
first becomes unreachable. Each pool needs a URL, a username (usually your
bitcoin payout address for solo pools, or worker name for regular pools) and
a password (often unused - defaults to `x`). Accepted URL formats:

| URL form | Protocol |
|----------|----------|
| `host:port` | Stratum V1 (e.g. `solo.ckpool.org:3333`) |
| `stratum+tcp://host:port` | Stratum V1 (explicit scheme) |
| `host:port/AUTHORITYKEY` | Stratum V2 (Noise-encrypted) |
| `stratum2+tcp://host:port/KEY` | Stratum V2 (explicit scheme) |

Each pool's connection is tested as it is entered. Stratum V1 pools are tested
with a real stratum handshake; Stratum V2 pools are encrypted so only TCP
reachability is tested. A pool that fails the test can still be kept, which is
useful for adding a failover pool that is currently down.

You will then be asked which local port ckproxy should listen on for your
miners (default 3334). Point your miners at the IP address of the proxy
machine on that port, e.g.:

```
stratum+tcp://192.168.1.100:3334
```

The proxy aggregates all your miners into a single upstream connection, which
substantially reduces bandwidth to the upstream pool and keeps working through
brief upstream outages.

Configuration is written to `/etc/ckpool/ckproxy.conf` and logs go to
`/var/log/ckproxy`. The service starts on boot and can be managed with:

```bash
systemctl status ckproxy
systemctl restart ckproxy
journalctl -u ckproxy -f
```

To change pools or ports later, edit `/etc/ckpool/ckproxy.conf` and restart the
service. See the `ckproxy.conf` example in the source directory for the full
list of configuration options, including Stratum V2 job declaration.

Good luck.
