# CKPOOL + CKPROXY + libckpool

by Con Kolivas

Ultra low overhead massively scalable multi-process, multi-threaded modular
bitcoin mining pool, proxy, passthrough, and library in c for Linux.

CKPOOL is code provided free of charge under the GPLv3 license but its
development is mostly paid for by commissioned funding, and the pool by default
contributes 0.5% of solved blocks in pool mode to the development team. Please
consider leaving this contribution in the code if you are running it on a pool
or contributing to the authors listed in [AUTHORS](AUTHORS) if you use this code
to aid funding further development.

## License

GNU Public license V3. See included [COPYING](COPYING) for details.

## Bitcoind & solo mining download and quickstart

```bash
wget https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/ckolivas/ckpool/src/master/scripts/install-ckpool-solo.sh
chmod +x install-ckpool-solo.sh
sudo ./install-ckpool-solo.sh
```

## Design

### Architecture

- Low level hand coded architecture relying on minimal outside libraries beyond
  basic glibc functions for maximum flexibility and minimal overhead that can be
  built and deployed on any Linux installation.

- Multiprocess+multithreaded design to scale to massive deployments and
  capitalise on modern multicore/multithread CPU designs.

- Minimal memory overhead.

- Utilises ultra reliable unix sockets for communication with dependent
  processes.

- Modular code design to streamline further development.

- Standalone library code that can be utilised independently of ckpool.

- Same code can be deployed in many different modes designed to talk to each
  other on the same machine, local lan or remote internet locations.

### Modes of deployment

- Simple pool.

- Simple pool with per-user solo mining.

- Simple proxy without the limitations of hashrate inherent in other proxy
  solutions when talking to ckpool.

- Passthrough node(s) that combine connections to a single socket which can
  be used to scale to millions of clients and allow the main pool to be isolated
  from direct communication with clients.

- Library for use by other software.

See the related file [README-CKPOOL_MODES.md](README-CKPOOL_MODES.md) for
detailed explanations of the various modes of operation.

### Features

- Bitcoind communication to unmodified bitcoind with multiple failover to local
  or remote locations.

- Local pool instance worker limited only by operating system resources and
  can be made virtually limitless through use of multiple downstream passthrough
  nodes.

- Proxy and passthrough modes can set up multiple failover upstream pools.

- Optional share logging.

- Virtually seamless restarts for upgrades through socket handover from exiting
  instances to new starting instance.

- Configurable custom coinbase signature.

- Configurable instant starting and minimum difficulty.

- Rapid vardiff adjustment with stable unlimited maximum difficulty handling.

- New work generation on block changes incorporate full bitcoind transaction
  set without delay or requiring to send transactionless work to miners thereby
  providing the best bitcoin network support and rewarding miners with the most
  transaction fees.

- Event driven communication based on communication readiness preventing
  slow communicating clients from delaying low latency ones.

- Stratum messaging system to running clients.

- Accurate pool and per client statistics.

- Multiple named instances can be run concurrently on the same machine.

## Building

Building ckpool requires no dependencies outside of the basic build tools and
yasm on any linux installation, but support features are recommended.

Minimal build:

```bash
sudo apt install build-essential yasm
```

Optional dependencies:

| Feature | Packages |
|---------|----------|
| ZMQ | `libzmq3-dev` |
| IPC | `libcapnp-dev` `capnproto` |
| SV2 | `libsodium-dev` |

Full build:

```bash
sudo apt install build-essential yasm libzmq3-dev libcapnp-dev capnproto \
	libsodium-dev
```

Followed by:

```bash
./configure
make
```

Building from git also requires autoconf, automake, and pkgconf:

```bash
sudo apt install build-essential yasm autoconf automake libtool pkgconf \
	libzmq3-dev libcapnp-dev capnproto libsodium-dev

./autogen.sh
./configure
make
```

Binaries will be built in the `src/` subdirectory. Binaries generated will be:

- `ckpool` - The main pool back end

- `ckproxy` - A link to ckpool that automatically starts it in proxy mode

- `ckpmsg` - An application for passing messages in libckpool format to ckpool

- `notifier` - An application designed to be run with bitcoind's `-blocknotify`
  to notify ckpool of block changes. Using IPC or ZMQ is much preferred.

Installation is NOT required and ckpool can be run directly from the directory
it's built in but it can be installed with:

```bash
sudo make install
```

## Running

ckpool supports the following options:

```
-B | --btcsolo
-c CONFIG | --config CONFIG
-g GROUP | --group GROUP
-H | --handover
-h | --help
-k | --killold
-L | --log-shares
-l LOGLEVEL | --loglevel LOGLEVEL
-N | --node
-n NAME | --name NAME
-P | --passthrough
-p | --proxy
-R | --redirector
-s SOCKDIR | --sockdir SOCKDIR
-u | --userproxy
```

`-B` will start ckpool in BTCSOLO mode, which is designed for solo mining. All
usernames connected must be valid bitcoin addresses, and 100% of the block
reward will go to the user solving the block, minus any donation set.

`-c <CONFIG>` tells ckpool to override its default configuration filename and
load the specified one. If `-c` is not specified, ckpool looks for `ckpool.conf`,
in proxy mode it looks for `ckproxy.conf`, in passthrough mode for
`ckpassthrough.conf` and in redirector mode for `ckredirector.conf`

`-g <GROUP>` will start ckpool as the group ID specified.

`-H` will make ckpool attempt to receive a handover from a running incidence of
ckpool with the same name, taking its client listening socket and shutting it
down.

`-h` displays the above help

`-k` will make ckpool shut down an existing instance of ckpool with the same
name, killing it if need be. Otherwise ckpool will refuse to start if an
instance of the same name is already running.

`-L` will log per share information in the logs directory divided by block
height and then workbase.

`-l <LOGLEVEL>` will change the log level to that specified. Default is 5 and
maximum debug is level 7.

`-N` will start ckpool in passthrough node mode where it behaves like a
passthrough but requires a locally running bitcoind and can submit blocks
itself in addition to passing the shares back to the upstream pool. It also
monitors hashrate and requires more resources than a simple passthrough. Be
aware that upstream pools must specify dedicated IPs/ports that accept
incoming node requests with the nodeserver directive described below.

`-n <NAME>` will change the ckpool process name to that specified, allowing
multiple different named instances to be running. By default the variant
names are used: ckpool, ckproxy, ckpassthrough, ckredirector, cknode.

`-P` will start ckpool in passthrough proxy mode where it collates all incoming
connections and streams all information on a single connection to an upstream
pool specified in `ckproxy.conf`. Downstream users all retain their individual
presence on the master pool. Standalone mode is implied.

`-p` will start ckpool in proxy mode where it appears to be a local pool
handling clients as separate entities while presenting shares as a single user
to the upstream pool specified. Note that the upstream pool needs to be a ckpool
for it to scale to large hashrates. Standalone mode is optional.

`-R` will start ckpool in a variant of passthrough mode. It is designed to be a
front end to filter out users that never contribute any shares. Once an
accepted share from the upstream pool is detected, it will issue a redirect to
one of the redirecturl entries in the configuration file. It will cycle over
entries if multiple exist, but try to keep all clients from the same IP
redirecting to the same pool.

`-s <SOCKDIR>` tells ckpool which directory to place its own communication
sockets (`/tmp` by default)

`-u` Userproxy mode will start ckpool in proxy mode as per the `-p` option
above, but in addition it will accept username/passwords from the stratum
connects and try to open additional connections with those credentials to the
upstream pool specified in the configuration file and then reconnect miners to
mine with their chosen username/password to the upstream pool.

`ckpmsg` and `notifier` support the `-n`, `-p` and `-s` options

## Configuration

At least one bitcoind is mandatory in ckpool mode with the minimum requirements
of server, rpcuser and rpcpassword set.

Ckpool takes a json encoded configuration file in `ckpool.conf` by default or
`ckproxy.conf` in proxy or passthrough mode unless specified with `-c`. Sample
configurations for ckpool and ckproxy are included with the source. Entries
after the valid json are ignored and the space there can be used for comments.
The options recognised are as follows:

`"btcd"` : This is an array of bitcoind(s) with the options url, auth and pass
which match the configured bitcoind. The optional boolean field notify tells
ckpool this btcd is using the notifier and does not need to be polled for block
changes. If no btcd is specified, ckpool will look for one on `localhost:8332`
with the username "user" and password "pass".

`"proxy"` : This is an array used in proxy and passthrough mode to set the
upstream pool(s) and is mandatory. Each entry takes url, auth and pass as for
btcd. Optional `"jds"` is documented under [Stratum V2](#stratum-v2) below. The
url may be a Stratum V1 address (host:port or stratum+tcp://host:port) or a
Stratum V2 address (see below); V1 and V2 upstreams may be mixed in the same
array.

`"btcaddress"` : This is the bitcoin address to try to generate blocks to. It is
ignored in BTCSOLO mode.

`"btcsig"` : This is an optional signature to put into the coinbase of mined
blocks.

`"blockpoll"` : This is the frequency in milliseconds for how often to check for
new network blocks and is 100 by default. It is intended to be a backup only
for when the notifier is not set up and only polls if the `"notify"` field is
not set on a btcd.

`"donation"` : Optional percentage donation of block reward that goes to the
developer of ckpool to assist in further development and maintenance of the
code. Takes a floating point value and defaults to zero if not set.

`"nodeserver"` : This takes the same format as the serverurl array and specifies
additional IPs/ports to bind to that will accept incoming requests for mining
node communications. It is recommended to selectively isolate this address
to minimise unnecessary communications with unauthorised nodes.

`"passthroughserver"` : This takes the same format as the serverurl array and
specifies additional IPs/ports to bind to that will accept incoming connections
from downstream ckpassthrough/ckredirector instances. Passthrough connections
are only accepted on these bindings, so a pool with no `"passthroughserver"`
entry will refuse them on its regular serverurl ports. It is recommended to
selectively isolate this address to minimise unnecessary communications with
unauthorised passthroughs.

`"nonce1length"` : This is optional allowing the extranonce1 length to be chosen
from 2 to 8. Default 4

`"nonce2length"` : This is optional allowing the extranonce2 length to be chosen
from 2 to 8. Default 8

`"update_interval"` : This is the frequency that stratum updates are sent out to
miners and is set to 30 seconds by default to help perpetuate transactions for
the health of the bitcoin network.

`"version_mask"` : This is a mask of which bits in the version number it is
valid for a client to alter and is expressed as an hex string. Eg `"00fff000"`
Default is `"1fffe000"`.

`"dropidle"` : Drop clients which have been idle for this duration in seconds,
use 0 to disable. Default 0.

`"serverurl"` : This is the IP(s) to try to bind ckpool uniquely to, otherwise
it will attempt to bind to all interfaces in port 3333 by default in pool mode
and 3334 in proxy mode. Multiple entries can be specified as an array by
either IP or resolvable domain name but the executable must be able to bind to
all of them and ports up to 1024 usually require privileged access.

`"redirecturl"` : This is an array of URLs that ckpool will redirect active
miners to in redirector mode. They must be valid resolvable URLs+ports.

`"mindiff"` : Minimum diff that vardiff will allow miners to drop to. Default 1

`"startdiff"` : Starting diff that new clients are given. Default 10000

`"maxdiff"` : Optional maximum diff that vardiff will clamp to where zero is no
maximum.

`"logdir"` : Which directory to store pool and client logs. Default `"logs"`

`"maxclients"` : Optional upper limit on the number of clients ckpool will
accept before rejecting further clients.

`"maxsubclients"` : Optional upper limit on the number of subclients any one
passthrough, node or trusted remote may have connected through it at once.
Unlike regular clients, subclients have no connection of their own to limit
them - each one exists purely because a downstream server said so, using an id
it chose - so this defaults to 65536 rather than being unlimited. Set it to a
negative value to disable the limit entirely. Subclients are additionally
limited to being created at 1000 per second per parent with a burst of 10000,
which is well above a large passthrough reconnecting every miner behind it at
once and only catches sustained churn.

`"zmqblock"` : Optional interface to use for zmq blockhash notification - ckpool
only. Requires use of matched bitcoind `-zmqpubhashblock` option.
Default: `tcp://127.0.0.1:28332`

`"ipcmining"` : Optional path to Bitcoin Core's mining IPC unix socket. In pool
mode this provides block notifications and template generation, bypassing zmq
and getblocktemplate when active (falling back to RPC if the interface is
unavailable). In proxy mode it is required when any proxy entry has a `"jds"`
Job Declaration client. Example: `"/tmp/btc-mining.sock"`
Requires bitcoind `-ipcbind`, e.g.:

```bash
bitcoind -m node -ipcbind=unix:/tmp/btc-mining.sock
```

No default.

## Stratum V2

Requires a build with libsodium (optional dependency above). Noise-encrypted
Stratum V2 is supported for pool/solo servers and for ckproxy upstreams.
Downstream miners on ckproxy remain Stratum V1.

### Pool / solo (ckpool server listen)

`"sv2url"` : Bind address(es) for SV2 Mining Protocol clients. Same form as
serverurl (string or array). Default port 3336 if no port is given. Pool and
btcsolo only; ignored in proxy, passthrough, node, redirector and userproxy.

`"sv2jdurl"` : Bind address(es) for SV2 Job Declaration (JDS). Same form as
sv2url. Default port 3337. Pools that offer job declaration advertise this
alongside the mining endpoint. Pool and btcsolo only.

`"sv2_authority_key"` : Path to the pool authority key file (Noise certificate
authority). If unset when sv2url or sv2jdurl is configured, defaults to
`<sockdir>/<name>/sv2_authority.key` and is created on first start if missing.
Miners and proxies must be given the matching base58check public key in their
connect URL.

`"sv2_static_key"` : Path to the server static Noise key. Defaults to
`<sockdir>/<name>/sv2_static.key` when unset and SV2 listen is enabled.

The default sockdir is `/tmp`, so without explicit paths the keys live under
`/tmp/<name>/` and are lost on reboot — the pool then generates new keys and
clients still holding the old authority pubkey can no longer connect. Set both
paths (or `-s sockdir`) to permanent locations in production.

Clients connect as:

```
stratum2+tcp://host:port/<base58check-authority-pubkey>
```

The path is required; the connection is refused if the key is missing or the
server certificate does not verify against it.

### Proxy (ckproxy upstream)

In each `"proxy"` array entry, url may be:

| URL form | Protocol |
|----------|----------|
| `host:port` | Stratum V1 (default) |
| `stratum+tcp://host:port` | Stratum V1 (explicit) |
| `stratum2+tcp://host:port/KEY` | Stratum V2 (KEY = pool authority pubkey) |
| `host:port/KEY` | Stratum V2 if KEY is a valid authority pubkey |

`"auth"` is sent as the SV2 channel user_identity (for solo JD pools this is
normally a bitcoin address). `"pass"` is unused on SV2 upstreams.

`"jds"` : Optional per-proxy Job Declaration Server endpoint (same host/KEY
form as an SV2 url, typically the pool's sv2jdurl port). Enables the proxy's
JD client: local templates from Bitcoin Core mining IPC are declared upstream
and, when accepted, custom jobs are mined instead of pool template work when
tips agree. Requires proxy mode, an SV2 url on the same entry, and `"ipcmining"`
pointing at a live bitcoind `-ipcbind` socket. Needs a Cap'n Proto-enabled
build.

Example pool fragment:

```json
  "sv2url": ["0.0.0.0:3336"],
  "sv2jdurl": ["0.0.0.0:3337"],
  "sv2_authority_key": "/tmp/ckpool/sv2_authority.key",
  "sv2_static_key": "/tmp/ckpool/sv2_static.key"
```

Example proxy fragment:

```json
  "proxy": [{
    "url": "stratum2+tcp://pool.example:3336/9anrRNhB…",
    "jds": "stratum2+tcp://pool.example:3337/9anrRNhB…",
    "auth": "bc1q….worker",
    "pass": "x"
  }],
  "ipcmining": "/tmp/btc-mining.sock"
```
