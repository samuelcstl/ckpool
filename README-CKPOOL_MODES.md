# CKPOOL modes

This document explains the different modes of operation for ckpool.

## Default mode

When run without any parameters, ckpool operates as a pool, combining all
hashrate to mine blocks to the same bitcoin address. The address must be
specified in the configuration file with the btcaddress, and 100% of the block
reward is mined to that address, minus any specified by the donation field. All
usernames are valid and are collated for statistics but have no influence on the
block reward. If no serverurl is specified, ckpool binds to all network
interfaces on port 3333. If a serverurl entry is specified with a port number
over 4000, that port acts as a high diff port, with a minimum difficulty of
1 million. A local bitcoin node is mandatory. If no name is specified with the
`-n` parameter, the file `ckpool.conf` is read for the configuration.

Mandatory config fields:

- At least one `"btcd"` entry with `"url"`, `"auth"`, and `"pass"`.
- `"btcaddress"`

## Solo mode

When run with the `-B` or `--btcsolo` parameter, ckpool operates as a per-username
pool, combining all hashrate from users connected with the same username. To
guarantee hashing is directed towards the user, usernames must be a valid
bitcoin address. 100% of the block reward is mined to the address of the
username that solves the block, minus any specified by the donation field. Other
config parameters are as per default mode.

Mandatory config fields:

- At least one `"btcd"` entry with `"url"`, `"auth"`, and `"pass"`.

## Proxy mode

When run with the `-p` or `--proxy` parameter, ckpool operates as a proxy to an
upstream pool, combining all hashrate and submitting it as hashes to the
upstream pool(s) specified in the `"proxy"` field as the user specified in the
`"auth"` subfield. The proxy fields are taken in order as a series of failover
pools to connect to in order as specified in the configuration file. All
usernames are valid and are collated for local statistics but have no influence
on the username used upstream. The proxy maintains a local difficulty equal to
or lower than the upsteam pool. If no serverurl is specified, ckproxy binds to
all network interfaces on port 3334. No special configuration is required at the
upstream pool, but it is highly recommended the pool have a large nonce2length
(such as 8 which is the default on ckpool.) Other config parameters are as per
default mode. If no name is specified with the `-n` parameter, the file
`ckproxy.conf` is read for the configuration.

Mandatory config fields:

- At least one `"proxy"` entry with `"url"`, `"auth"`, and `"pass"`.

## Userproxy mode

When run with the `-u` or `--userproxy` parameter, ckpool operates as a per-user
proxy to an upstream pool, combining hashrate per-user and submitting it as
hashes to the upstream pool(s) specified in the `"proxy"` field as the username
connected, or as specified in the proxy `"auth"` subfield if that username is
invalid. As per the proxy mode, the proxy fields are taken in order as a series
of failover pools to connect to in order as specified in the configuration file.
All usernames are presumed to be valid and are collated for local statistics,
and their hashes are contributed to the upstream pool according to their
username. If their username is invalid with the upstream pool, their hashes are
contributed according to that specified in the proxy `"auth"` subfield. Other
config parameters are as per proxy mode.

Mandatory config fields:

- At least one `"proxy"` entry with `"url"`, `"auth"`, and `"pass"`.

## Passthrough mode

When run with the `-P` or `--passthrough` parameter, ckpool operates as a
transparent per-user passthrough to an upstream pool. It connects to the pool
specified in the `"proxy"` `"url"` subfield using the `"auth"` and `"pass"`
subparameters, but simply passes through all data to/from any users connected.
It collates data from all incoming connections and sends them all to the
upstream pool over the one upstream connection. No user or hash management of
any kind is performed; it is all handled by the upstream pool. The purpose of
this mode is to provide access to a pool not available to the user from their
local networking due to being geoblocked, or firewalled off, or the pool being
on an isolated subnet. It also decreases the number of open sockets the pool
must maintain. If no serverurl is specified, ckpassthrough binds to all network
interfaces on port 3334. If no name is specified with the `-n` parameter, the
file `ckpassthrough.conf` is read for the configuration.

Mandatory config fields:

- At least one `"proxy"` entry with `"url"`, `"auth"`, and `"pass"`.

Mandatory upstream pool config fields:

- At least one `"passthroughserver"` entry, and the `"proxy"` `"url"` above must
  point at it. Upstream ckpool instances only accept passthrough connections on
  bindings listed there.

## Redirector mode

When run with the `-R` or `--redirector` parameter, ckpool operates in the same
manner as passthrough mode, but also monitors share results coming from the
upstream pool. Once it detects a valid share result, it then attempts to
redirect that user to mine directly to the pool specified in the
`"redirecturl"` fields in a round-robin fashion using the reconnect function.
Note that if the mining client is cgminer based, it will refuse to reconnect to
the upstream proxy unless it has the same subdomain name - eg if ckredirector is
on east.ckpool.org, it will only reconnect to `*.ckpool.org` to prevent hashrate
hijacking. Additionally many newer stratum clients do not respect the reconnect
field at all. If the client refuses to reconnect directly to the upstream proxy,
ckredirector continues to act as a passthrough. Config is as per passthrough
mode. If no name is specified with the `-n` parameter, the file
`ckredirector.conf` is read for the configuration.

Mandatory config fields:

- At least one `"proxy"` entry with `"url"`, `"auth"`, and `"pass"`.
- At least one `"redirecturl"` entry.

Mandatory upstream pool config fields:

- At least one `"passthroughserver"` entry, matching the `"proxy"` `"url"` above.

## Node mode

When run with the `-N` or `--node` parameter, ckpool operates as a sub-pool of an
upstream master pool or pools specified in the `"proxy"` fields. The upstream
pool must be a ckpool instance running in default mode (solo mode is currently
unsupported), with a corresponding `"nodeserver"` entry. A local bitcoin node is
mandatory. All user management is done by the upstream pool. The cknode instance
will store a local log only of users connected to it. Cknode will attempt to
keep its local bitcoin node informed of the transactions being mined at the
master pool. If a block is solved by a user connected to cknode, it will attempt
to submit it to its local bitcoin node in addition to the upstream pool to speed
up propagation of the block. If the upstream pool solves a block separate from
the cknode instance, the cknode instance will also attempt to submit the block
locally. If the local bitcoin node is missing transactions in a solved block
(unlikely), it will be unable to submit the block locally, but this does not
prevent the upstream pool from submitting it. The purpose of cknode mode is to
have geographically remote pools of one master pool for faster block submission.
It is highly recommended to increase rmem_max and wmem_max in `sysctl.conf` as
large packets will be sent between cknode and an upstream pool. Config is as per
default mode. If no name is specified with the `-n` parameter, the file
`cknode.conf` is read for the configuration.

Mandatory config fields:

- At least one `"btcd"` entry with `"url"`, `"auth"`, and `"pass"`.
- At least one `"proxy"` entry with `"url"` matching the upstream nodeserver,
  `"auth"`, and `"pass"`.

Mandatory upstream pool config fields:

- At least one `"nodeserver"` entry.

## Trusted mode

When run with the `-t` or `--trusted` node parameter, ckpool operates as a
sub-pool of an upstream master pool specified in the `"upstream"` field. The
upstream pool must be a ckpool instance with a corresponding `"trusted"` entry.
A local bitcoin node is mandatory. All user management is done by the upstream
pool. The trusted instance will store a local log only of users connected to it.
All share management is handled by the local trusted ckpool instance, and only a
record of accepted/rejected shares is submitted to the upstream pool. As this is
done in clear text without verification, the connection between the two must be
suitably isolated from outside connections to prevent fake share accounting
being accepted by the upstream pool. Only locally solved blocks are submitted by
a trusted node. The purpose of trusted mode is to isolate the main accounting
pool from outwardly facing ip addresses, or for friendly centrally collating
record keeping. Config is as per default mode. If no name is specified with the
`-n` parameter, the file `ckpool.conf` is read for the configuration.

Mandatory config fields for remote (trusted) server:

- At least one `"btcd"` entry with `"url"`, `"auth"`, and `"pass"`.
- At least one `"upstream"` entry with `"url"` matching the upstream server.

Mandatory upstream pool config fields:

- At least one `"btcd"` entry with `"url"`, `"auth"`, and `"pass"`.
- At least one `"trusted"` array entry for IP:port to bind to and listen for
  remote servers.
